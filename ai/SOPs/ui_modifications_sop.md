For a kid-friendly version of the real-time talking experience, here's how I would modify the current UI:

### MVP UI Modifications

1. **Simplified Layout**
- Remove technical elements (device selector, volume controls)
- Remove chat history (kids focus on immediate interaction)
- Make the microphone button larger and more playful
- Use larger, more readable fonts
- Implement bright, friendly colors

2. **Core Elements (Top to Bottom)**
```
[Word to Practice]
      â†“
[Character Area]
      â†“
[Big Friendly Mic Button]
      â†“
[Simple Feedback Text]
```

3. **Visual States**
- Word Display: Large, bold, kid-friendly font
- Character: Center stage, large and visible
- Mic Button: 
  * Green when ready
  * Red when recording
  * Yellow when processing
- Feedback: Simple, encouraging messages with emojis

4. **Interaction Flow**
```
Ready â†’ "Let's practice the word 'cat'!"
User Speaking â†’ "I'm listening..." + listening animation
Processing â†’ "Let me think..." + thinking animation
AI Response â†’ "Great job!" or "Let's try again!" + speaking animation
```

Here's a rough pseudocode structure for the modified KidsPage:

```typescript
function KidsPage() {
  // Core states
  const [currentWord, setCurrentWord] = useState("cat");
  const [micState, setMicState] = useState<'ready' | 'listening' | 'processing'>('ready');
  const [feedback, setFeedback] = useState("Click the microphone to start!");

  // Simplified messages for kids
  const messages = {
    ready: "Click the microphone and say the word!",
    listening: "I'm listening...",
    processing: "Let me think...",
    success: "Great job! ðŸŒŸ",
    tryAgain: "Let's try again! You can do it! ðŸ’ª"
  };

  return (
    <div className="kids-page">
      {/* Word Display */}
      <div className="word-card">
        {currentWord}
      </div>

      {/* Character */}
      <Character 
        isListening={micState === 'listening'}
        isSpeaking={micState === 'processing'}
      />

      {/* Big Friendly Mic Button */}
      <button 
        className={`mic-button ${micState}`}
        onClick={handleMicClick}
      >
        ðŸŽ¤
      </button>

      {/* Simple Feedback */}
      <div className="feedback">
        {feedback}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Would you like me to provide specific implementation details for any of these components? I can help with:

1. The kid-friendly styling
2. The simplified microphone interaction
3. The character animation integration
4. The feedback system
5. The word display component

Let me know which aspect you'd like to tackle first!
